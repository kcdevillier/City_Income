
Can we use free publicly avaiable data to draw correlations between Per Capita Income and count and type of business?
This project tries to answer that question. 

Use of Machine Learning Algorithms to Correlate business & Per Capita Income
Used web scraping to collect population estimates for 50 random US cities
Utilized API calls to the Bureau of Economic Analysis to gather per capita income for cities and to gather business data from Yelp Fusion API  
Cleaned and organized into database and ran machine learning algorithms to determine correlations 
Tools used: Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, BeautifulSoup, and Selinium
